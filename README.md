# Water Quality Monitoring System - WQMS
This repository stores information and data relative to the design of a WQMS using IoT sensors, LoRa wireless technology and online dashboards via ThingSpeak.
The system was calibrated in lab and validate in Cubatão River, arounding Cubayão City, São Paulo, Brazil in december, 2024.
